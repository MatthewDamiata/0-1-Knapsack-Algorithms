# 0/1 Knapsack Algorithms
## CS375 - Fall 2020
### Solo Project

## Project Description

This program solves the 0/1 Knapsack problem using 4 different algorithms: Greedy Algorithm, Improved Greedy Algorithm, Backtracking Algorithm, and Dynamic Programming Algorithm. 

## Use

There are several input files in the /test folder of the repository which describe items to be placed into the backpack, defined by their weight and profit. Choose any input file, compile the program with javac, and execute the program as follows:

```
java knapsack input.txt output.txt 3

```
where the first argument is the input file, the second argument is the output file, and the third argument selected algorithm.

0 - Greedy Algorithm

1 - Improved Greedy Algorithm

2 - Backtracking Algorithm

3 - Dynamic Programming Algorithm
